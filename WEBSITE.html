    <h1>STRATEGIES</h1>
<p1>WAKULIMA is a  Non Government Organisation formed in 2019. We are an umbrella organization that coordinates and promotes the development of mordern farming among farmers, distributors and consumers through networking and information distribution. It  sees development of the  farming sector as a crucial factor for sustainable livelihoods and envisions establishing a vibrant, sustainable and mutually beneficial agriculture sector in Tanzania.</p1>

<p2> Its members include various types of institutions and organizations such as farmers associations and cooperatives, NGOs, organic operators, companies, distributors, researchers and trainers. Wakulima provides and distributes information on mordern farming to its members and other stakeholders in the whole of Tanzania.</p2>

<section id="bes"><div class="container"><h1></h1></div></section>
<p7><h7>Awareness Creation</h7> 
  Consumer understanding of the benefits and advantages of modern agriculture and it's products is still developing. Although farmers and experts from various institutions have acknowledged the potential of modern farming, the majority of people in East Africa have not fully appreciated modern farming  or the attractive market opportunities they bring. Hence increasing public awareness and understanding of mordern farming and it's products is one of our core objectives. Tapping into public opinion enables stakeholders to respond appropriately to environmental opportunities and challenges relating to modern agriculture. At the same time consumers start to appreciate the possibility of enjoying healthy, safe and sustainably produced goods.</p7>

<h1>Capacity Building</h1> <p>
  Knowledge and experience are key factors for building a sustainable advanced agriculture sector. Knowledge on modern farming principles, standards and quality management systems, and technical know-how on production and pest management practices are essential to our members. Through organising training courses and supporting agriculture training centres, knowledge and experience of modern farming is gathered and distributed among a wide range of stakeholders. Our competent trainers, facilitators and technical staff are providing high quality training courses on modern agriculture and value chain development.</p8>

<h1>Information</h1> <p>
  The accumulation, handling and distribution of information on the agriculture sector is another focus point. The exchange of information between members and stakeholders is promoted, and strong collaboration with research institutions helps by investigating, understanding and documenting modern farming practices. The collected information about modern farming practices enables the realization of further improvements and developments.</p>

<h1>Lobbying and Advocacy</h1> <p>
 Together with our members and partners we work to gain widespread support for modern farming. We create opportunities to convince officials, government institutions, and policy makers of the many benefits modern farming brings, and work to influence decision makers to promote the modern farming agenda.</p>

<h1>Linkages and Networking</h1> <p>
 In order to realize a sustainable agricultural future, we need strong ties between agriculture organizations. We aim to facilitate new networks and expand existing ones. Networks allow our members to learn from each other, share knowledge and develop a stronger voice on the national and international stage.</p>

<h1>Approach and Methodology</h1>

<p>WAKULIMA uses the Value Chain Development Approach to foster economic growth with poverty reduction through involvement of large numbers of small holder farmers. Farmers are trained on the structures, systems and relationships that define the value chain. WAKULIMA helps to improve or upgrade their products and processes, to access and develop domestic and international markets and enhance trade and quality of agriculture products. As a consequence smallholder farmers are able to raise their level of income, create wealth and escape poverty. WAKULIMA plays a facilitator role to the value chain actors by establishing linkages and building the capacity for the value chain to operate sustainably.</p>
